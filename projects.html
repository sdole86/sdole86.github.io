            <h3>Poke-a-Teletubby</h3>
            <div>
                <p><a href="/projects/javascript/pokeatubby/" target="_blank">Link</a>: This was the final for my introduction to Javascript class. This is a simple whack a mole style game with a Teletubby theme. I used a couple of tricks to make this one appear more "game-like" such as randomizing the placement of the "moles", randomizing which graphic was used, and randomizing how long the player has to "whack them". As an added bonus, this project contains Teletubby trivia at the bottom of the page. I'm sure this information will pay off should trivia night at the local pub ever include a children's programming question.</p>

The original SQL database was hosted on AWS and was shared among the class. It was an interesting experience to use this DB as my classmates entered number of improperly formatted entries that my application wasn't initially configured to handle. It was a great lesson on expecting the unexpected in development.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/sdole86/Snake" target="_blank">Link</a>: This one was built off a tutorial from Edureka to create a simple Snake-like game in Python. After finishing the tutorial I decided to implement some of my own customizations to the code including increasing difficulty as the player gains points as well as adding some additional classes to the code to make it more readable.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/sdole86/ModuleOperator" target="_blank">Link</a>: A coworker of mine started a Python course. In my journey to learn Python I asked him to share his lessons with me to see if I can figure them out despite having no formal experience with the language. This particular assignment was to understand how the module operator works. This code requests two numerical inputs from the user that set up a range. It then iterate through the range to check if that particular number is divisible by 3, 5, or both.</p>
