            <p><a href="https://github.com/sdole86/ModuleOperator" target="_blank">GitHub</a>: A coworker of mine started a Python course. In my journey to learn Python I asked him to share his lessons with me to see if I can figure them out despite having no formal experience with the language. This particular assignment was to understand how the module operator works. This code requests two numerical inputs from the user that set up a range. It then iterate through the range to check if that particular number is divisible by 3, 5, or both.</p>
