                    <p>My name is Samuel Dole and I am an aspiring web designer and software developer. I have been fascinated with coding ever since I discovered RPG Maker 2003 decades ago. It was a simple engine but it gave me my first taste of development. I would spend hours in middle school crafting project after project, always happily starting over and starting a new one as new ideas and techniques came to mind. As I got older I pursued my other passion: history. My original bachelor's was in the history of the ancient world, specifically Greece and Rome, and I had a wonderful time studying and learning all I could about the ancient world. </p>
                    <p>When I graduated and entered the work force I had forgotten about my love of code until I was offered the opportunity to work in IT doing basic desktop support. I had always had a passion for technology and this was a great chance to use this passion to help others. As I took to this job I found a great joy in scripting in PowerShell to make my tasks more efficient. As I learned more and more I eventually began assisting with other, more complicated scripting projects. It wasn't long before I reignited my childhood interest in coding. I went back to school and began to educate myself in development in earnest. I've tried my hand at Java, Javascript, C#, PHP, and Python. I've found that I'm always excited to learn more and to better myself.</p>
