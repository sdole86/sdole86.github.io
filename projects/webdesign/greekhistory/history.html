	<P><b>Ancient Greece</b> was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history 
	  from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th–9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (c. AD 600). This era was immediately 
	  followed by the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine period.[1] Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age 
	  collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the Archaic 
	  period and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the age of Classical Greece, from the 
	  Greco-Persian Wars to the 5th to 4th centuries BC. The conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon spread Hellenistic 
	  civilization from the western Mediterranean to Central Asia. The Hellenistic period ended with the conquest of the 
	  eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, and the annexation of the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, 
	  and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.</P>
	  
	  <P><a id="bronze"></a><b>Bronze Age</b> (Cycladic culture, Minoan and Helladic); chronology covering a period beginning with the transition to a metal-based economy in 3200/3100 BC during the Eutresis culture and Korakou culture, Cycladic culture with its special figurines, Europe's first real civilization (Minoan civilization), Tiryns culture, to the rise and fall of the Mycenaean Greek palaces in the Late Bronze Age collapse. Spans roughly five centuries (1600–1100 BC). The <a href="myth.html#trojan">Trojan War</a> is a legendary example of this time period where Greek heroes such as Achilles fought Trojan heroes like Hector.
	  </P>
	  
	  <P><a id="dark"></a>The <b>Dark Ages</b> is the period of Greek history from the end of the Mycenaean palatial civilization around 1100 BC to the beginning of the Archaic age around 750 BC.<br><br>

		The archaeological evidence shows a widespread collapse of Bronze Age civilization in the Eastern Mediterranean world at the outset of the period, as the great palaces and cities of the Mycenaeans were destroyed or abandoned. At about the same time, the Hittite civilization suffered serious disruption and cities from Troy to Gaza were destroyed and in Egypt the New Kingdom fell into disarray that led to the Third Intermediate Period.</P>	
	  
	  <P><a id="archaic"></a>The <b>Archaic Period</b> of Greece was the period in Greek history lasting from the eighth century BC to the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC, following the Greek Dark Ages and succeeded by the Classical period. In the archaic period, Greeks settled across the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, as far as Marseille in the west and Trapezus (Trebizond) in the east; and by the end of the archaic period, they were part of a trade network that spanned the entire Mediterranean.
	  </P>
	  
	  <P><a id="classical"></a>The <b>Classical Period</b> of Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of Western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. Tales of the <a href="people.html#leonidas">King Leonidas of Sparta</a> still hold a powerful place in modern popular culture as depicted in the comic / movie 300.
	  </P>
	  
	  <P><a id="hellenistic"></a>The <b>Hellenistic Period</b> of Greece is the historical period of the country following Classical Greece, between the death of <a href="people.html#alexander">Alexander the Great</a> in 323 BC and the annexation of the classical Greek Achaean League heartlands by the Roman Republic. This culminated at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Corinth_(146_BC)">Battle of Corinth</a> in 146 BC, a crushing Roman victory in the Peloponnese that led to the destruction of Corinth and ushered in the period of Roman Greece. Hellenistic Greece's definitive end was with the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, when the future emperor Augustus defeated Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony, the next year taking over Alexandria, the last great center of Hellenistic Greece.
	  </P>
	  
	  <P><a id="roman"></a>The <b>Roman</b> era of Greek history began with the Corinthian defeat in the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC. However, before the Achaean War, the Roman Republic had been steadily gaining control of mainland Greece by defeating the Kingdom of Macedon in a series of conflicts known as the Macedonian Wars. The Fourth Macedonian War ended at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pydna">Battle of Pydna</a> in 148 BC and defeat of the Macedonian royal pretender Andriscus. <a href="people.html#diaeus">Diaeus of Megalopolis</a> is famously the last Greek strategos before the Achaien League was disbanded by the Romans</B>
