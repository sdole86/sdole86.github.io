		   <h3>Tinky Winky</h3>
		   <div>
			 <p>
			 Tinky Winky (played by Dave Thompson and Simon Shelton in the original series and by Jeremiah Krage in the revival series) is the first Teletubby, as well as the largest and oldest of the group. He is covered in purple terrycloth and has a triangular antenna on his head. He often carries a red bag. Not only is Tinky Winky the biggest Teletubby. He is also very kind and gentle. Tinky Winky loves walking, marching, dancing and falling over. He has a special song which he loves to sing to himself. Tinky Winky loves very big hugs.
			 </p>
		   </div>
		   <h3>Dipsy</h3>
		   <div>
			 <p>
			 Dipsy (played by John Simmit in the original series and by Nick Kellington in the revival series) is the second Teletubby. He is green and named after his antenna, which resembles a dipstick. Dipsy is the most stubborn of the Teletubbies, and will occasionally refuse to go along with the others' group opinion. His face is notably darker than the rest of the Teletubbies, and the creators have stated that he is black. He often wears a large hat with a black and white pattern.
			 </p>
		   </div>
		   <h3>Laa-Laa</h3>
		   <div>
			 <p>
			 Laa-Laa (played by Nikky Smedley in the original series and by Rebecca Hyland in the revival series) is the third Teletubby. She is yellow and has a curly antenna. Laa-Laa is very sweet, likes to sing and dance, and is often shown looking out for the other Teletubbies. Her favourite toy is an orange rubber ball.
			 </p>
		   </div>
		   <h3>Po</h3>
		   <div>
			 <p>
			 Po (played by Pui Fan Lee in the original series and by Rachelle Beinart in the revival series) is the fourth Teletubby, as well as the shortest and youngest. She is red and has an antenna shaped like a stick used for blowing soap bubbles. Po normally speaks in a soft voice and has been stated by the show's creators to be Cantonese; she sometimes speaks the language. Her favourite toy is a pink and blue scooter.
